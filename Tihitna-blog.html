            <p><b>Forbidden Identity</b><br>
                In my opinion if I asked to change the title of born a crime book i will call it as “Forbidden
                Identity” because THis title can express the an iddentity that isn't
                allowed or accepted in the society due to cultural,political
                and also caltural reasons and also this phrase can express the struggle to live in forbidden
                environment,addvocating for inclusivness and acceptance in that environment.</p>

                    "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional  wife...but he never fell in love with
                    subservilent women...He only wants a woman who is free bcause his dream is to put her in acage."
                    This quote in Traver noah born a crime book shows Abel wanted a woman who he can control but hegot 
                    a true opposite of he wanted because Patricia was a woman used to doing what she wanted she was
                    independent and confident about what she does.The quote can be related to gender roles in today's
                    sociaity while many women are still responsible for specific roles especially in home responsiblities
                    while men may have the responsibility to be the provider and control a dominant position. The
                    pressure can create tention in relationships for example, If we see some ethiopian men might desire
                    tradition girl valuing family ,respect and religion however attracted to a modern girl’s independent
                    and confidence.This causes dissatisfaction and misunderstanding in the relationship because of the
                    opposite desires according to tradition woman desire for social acceptance and also personal desire
                    in modern woman. Abel’s desire toward Patricia shows that people are attracted to strong personalities.
                    A woman who knows her choice,standard and a woman who has confidence,who believes inherself is attractive
                     in nature, because people are attracted to people who believe in themselves.The reason that abel wants a 
                     woman who is traditional was due to his dream to put her in a cage this can show sexism insights naw a 
                     day marige maight prevent for womens’ growth even if there is nocontrol of men over women.Domestic 
                     responsibilities and attitude can prevent womens growth we can see points such as learning after marriage,
                     and also giving birth.because of social expectation,child care burden,carrer interruption because of giving 
                     birth this all causes low development of women after marriage.so that it is not bad if we call it hidden cage.
